# 🐚 Minishell – A Tiny UNIX Shell

**Minishell** is a **42 Vienna** project that involves creating a lightweight UNIX shell from scratch. It replicates bash behavior by handling command execution, pipes, redirections, environment variables, signals, built-in commands, and wildcard expansion.

This was a duo project, with clear responsibilities:

## 🛠 My Contributions:

* Tokenization & Parsing – Splitting user input into structured commands.
* Execution Flow – Running commands, handling pipes & redirections.
* Wildcard Expansion (*) – Implementing pattern matching for filenames.

## My Partner’s Contributions:

* Built-in Commands – Implementing echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit.
* Environment Variable Management – Handling export, unset, $VAR expansion.
* Signal Handling – Managing Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and Ctrl+\.

## Features

* Interactive Shell – Displays a prompt and processes user input.
* Tokenization & Parsing – Converts input into a structured format.
* Execution Management – Runs commands via execve().
* Pipes (|) – Handles multi-command execution with inter-process communication.
* Redirections (<, >, >>) – Implements input/output redirection.
* Heredoc (<<) – Reads input until a delimiter is reached.
* Wildcard Expansion (*) – Matches filenames dynamically.
* Built-in Commands – Implements echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit.
* Environment Variables ($VAR) – Expands variables dynamically.
* Signal Handling – Handles Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and Ctrl+\.
* Exit Status Management ($?) – Stores last command’s exit code.
* Syntax Error Handling – Detects invalid syntax and prints error messages.

## Built-in Commands (Partner’s Contribution)

* echo	Prints text to stdout. Supports -n flag.
* cd	Changes the current directory.
* pwd	Prints the current working directory.
* export	Sets environment variables.
* unset	Removes environment variables.
* env	Displays all environment variables.
* exit	Exits the shell with a status code.

## Tokenization & Parsing (My Contribution)

🔹 Lexing & Tokenization

* Converts user input into tokens (commands, arguments, operators).
* Recognizes quotes (", '), redirections (<, >), and pipes (|).

🔹 Parsing & AST Construction

* Structures commands into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
* Groups pipes, redirections, and logical operators (&&, ||).

## Execution & Wildcard Expansion (My Contribution)

🔹 Command Execution

* Executes built-in commands (handled by my partner).
* Runs external commands using execve().
* Handles pipes using dup2() and redirections (<, >).

🔹 Wildcard Expansion (*)

* Implements filename pattern matching similar to bash.
* Uses opendir() and readdir() to retrieve directory contents.

## Environment & Signals (Partner’s Contribution)

🔹 Environment Variables

* Implements export, unset, and $VAR expansion.
* Modifies and retrieves environment variables dynamically.

🔹 Signal Handling

* Manages SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and EOF (Ctrl+D).
* Ensures clean exit and proper signal responses.

## What I Learned

* Lexing & Parsing – Converting raw input into structured commands.
* Process management – Using fork(), execve(), waitpid().
* File descriptors & redirections – Managing pipes via dup2().
* Wildcard Expansion (*) – Implementing pattern matching for filenames.
* Handling pipes & heredocs – Ensuring smooth execution flow.
